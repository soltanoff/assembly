ABOUT CPU
-----------

Texas Instruments TMS320 is a blanket name for a series of digital signal 
processors (DSPs) from Texas Instruments. It was introduced on April 8, 
1983 through the TMS32010 processor, which was then the fastest DSP on the 
market.

The processor is available in many different variants, some with fixed-point 
arithmetic and some with floating point arithmetic. The floating point DSP 
TMS320C3x, which exploits delayed branch logic, has as many as three delay 
slots.

The flexibility of this line of processors has led to it being used not 
merely as a co-processor for digital signal processing but also as a main 
CPU. Newer implementations support standard IEEE JTAG control for boundary 
scan and/or in-circuit debugging.

SOFTWARE SUPPORT
-----------

The TMS320 series can be programmed using C, C++, and/or assembly language. 
Most work on the TMS320 processors is done using Texas Instruments 
proprietary toolchain and their integrated development environment Code 
Composer Studio, which includes a mini operating system called DSP/BIOS. 
Additionally, a department at the Chemnitz University of Technology has 
developed preliminary support for the TMS320C6x series in the GNU Compiler 
Collection.
